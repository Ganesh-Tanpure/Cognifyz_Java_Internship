Different Number Patterns Program:

Created the program and printed different simple number patterns by harnessing the power of loops to control their structures. 
For this task, I selected the multiple number patterns and delved into developing a program that could generate this unique patterns flawlessly. By skillfully using loops to manage the pattern's intricate structure, the results were both fascinating and rewarding. 

This program consists of different patterns as follows:
1.Right Angle Triangle Pattern
2.Inverted Right-Angle Triangle Pattern
3.Pyramid Number Pattern
4.Inverted Pyramid Number Pattern
5.Diamond Number Pattern
6.Palindromic Number Pattern
7.Hollow Diamond Number Pattern
